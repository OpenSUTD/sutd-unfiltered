Dear XX,

I'm Alexander, a EPD Junior, and I'm planning SUTD Unfiltered, a small sharing session where we invite speakers to share their unfiltered experiences, in partnership with OpenSUTD. 

I'd like to invite you to join us as a speaker on 17th September (Tuesday) because I think you're an interesting person with equally interesting stories to share. This session's theme is Summer Unfiltered, so we'd be most excited if you share something about your summer experience - be it internship stories or exchange escapades.  The presentations will be done in the 20 x 20 PechaKucha format (see here: DANK PECHA KUCHA FORMAT) so as to keep things short and entertaining.

Do get back to me if you're keen or curious! 

Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Alexander
