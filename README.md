# SUTD Unfiltered Planning Repo
Planning and Ops for this Human Library knock-off.

## What is SUTD Unfiltered?
It's a short sharing session where speakers share unfiltered experiences in lightning fast presentations about things that they're interested in. It also involves alcohol, but that's another story.

## Who do I contact if I'm interested in this?
The current planners are Alex (WilburthePiggy) and Qing Ze (fishbiscuit). Leave an issue or something.

## What's the site for this?
Dis: https://wilburthepiggy.github.io/sutd-unfiltered/

## Can I do my own version of this?
Yeah, sure why not. It's under the OpenSUTD umbrella, so do talk to the people in there first so you're not doing double the work.
